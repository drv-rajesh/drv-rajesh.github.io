I utilized the situation in 2020 to my full advantage, and here's how I want to continue staying productive. Feel free to use certain categories as templates for generating your own bucket list!

## Portfolio
I want to constantly learn and develop myself - and in order to maintain that principle, here are some goals I set for myself:
- Finish at least two software portfolio projects (50%)
- Finish one hardware portfolio project (0%)
- Get this portfolio website fully spiced up with CSS and finished (60%)

## Content
Sharing your knowledge is of cruciality to me, therefore I set these goals:
- Reach 100 subscribers (42%)
- Upload 50 videos (2%)
- Reach 100 hours of watchtime (88%)

## Personal
Aside from academic/portfolio development, personal development is also very important - here are the goals I want to reach:
- Recover from slumping/stay more focused
- At least 30 minutes of exercise each day
