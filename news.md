<p> Each week, I publish a collation of my favourite new developments from the engineering, science, and technology fields. </p>

<h1> Week of 2021-01-25 </h1>

<h3> Two Patients, Single Ventilator </h3>
<p> An open-source diagram was released to help doctors safely ventilate two COVID patients with a single ventilator, utilzing current resistance as a basis. <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/open-source-model-created-to-help-clinicians-safely-ventilate-two-covid-19-patients-with-a-single-ventilator/"> Read more </a> </p>

<h3> Art AI Has a Potential Use in Autonomous Vehicles </h3>
<p> OpenAI created a program to generate random art that doesn't exist - however the algorithm it uses, CLIP (based on a NN), can be used for image recognition in self-driving cars. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-go-art-steering-self-driving-car/"> Read more </a> </p>

<h3> The Truth About Weighted Blankets </h3>
<p> Weighted blankets, a simple stress reliever, is put to the test in three different ways. <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/science/weighted-blankets-anxiety/"> Read more </a> </p>

<h3> Vitals-Sensing Kiosks on the MIT Campus </h3>
<p> Ivan Goryachev and Ryan Koeppen, two mechanical engineering students, are developing thermal trailers and vitals-sensing kiosks that are to be deployed around the campus during COVID-19. <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/deploying-non-contact-vitals-sensing-kiosks-across-campus-0111"> Read more </a> </p>

<h3> Ultrasound Drills Eliminating Blood Clots </h3>
<p> Researchers developed a technique to eliminate tough blood clots through engineering nanodroplets and an ultrasonic drill. <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/ultrasound-drills-and-nanodroplets-and-prove-effective-at-tackling-tough-blood-clots/"> Read more </a> </p>

<h3> NASA Uses AI To Detect Craters on Mars </h3>
<p> NASA used a machine learning algorithm to detect fresh craters, trained using low-resolution grayscale "Context" images and high-resolution "HiRISE" images. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nasa-is-training-an-ai-to-detect-fresh-craters-on-mars/"> Read more </a> </p>
