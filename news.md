<h3> Vitals-Sensing Kiosks on the MIT Campus </h3>
<p> Ivan Goryachev and Ryan Koeppen, two mechanical engineering students, are developing thermal trailers and vitals-sensing kiosks that are to be deployed around the campus during COVID-19. <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2021/deploying-non-contact-vitals-sensing-kiosks-across-campus-0111"> Read more </a> </p>

<h3> Ultrasound Drills Eliminating Blood Clots </h3>
<p> Researchers developed a technique to eliminate tough blood clots through engineering nanodroplets and an ultrasonic drill. <a href="https://scitechdaily.com/ultrasound-drills-and-nanodroplets-and-prove-effective-at-tackling-tough-blood-clots/"> Read more </a> </p>

<h3> NASA Uses AI To Detect Craters on Mars </h3>
<p> NASA used a machine learning algorithm to detect fresh craters, trained using low-resolution grayscale "Context" images and high-resolution "HiRISE" images. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nasa-is-training-an-ai-to-detect-fresh-craters-on-mars/"> Read more </a> </p>
