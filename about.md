  I know plenty a fact - apparently the largest countable number is a googolplex, and your brain's fusiform gyrus is used for facial recognition - and I love reading stacks of quotes - "Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master" or "The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain" - but most importantly, I am a full-stack developer and engineer who loves learning something new everyday.

  I aspire to be a Mechatronics Engineer so that my skills in software and hardware can integrate. I can apply software skills to areas such as IOT and hardware interfacing, and my engineering skills to the mechanical component of mechatronics, robotics.
