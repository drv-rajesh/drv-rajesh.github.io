  I know plenty a fact - apparently the largest countable number is a googolplex, and your brain's fusiform gyrus is used for facial recognition - and I love reading stacks of quotes - "Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master" or "The way I see it, if you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain" - but most importantly, I am a full-stack developer who loves learning something new everyday.
